## Usage
The app displays the current day at the top. Click into a block of time to schedule an appointment. Press the save button to save the appointment in local storage. You can only schedule events for an hour of the day that is current or in the future. You may edit the appointment blocks as well. If you need to clear all your appointments for the day, use the button at the bottom of the page. The planner resets at the start of a new day.
